Once a prominent figure in the clan, Matthew, fondly known as Matty, was a force to be reckoned with - competitive, 
skilled, and highly respected among his peers. He was known for his relentless trash-talking directed at Michael 
(Moses), boasting about his significantly higher Kill Death Ratio and claiming to be the superior gamer overall. 
His confident demeanor and impressive gaming abilities made him a standout member of the team.

However, things have taken a different turn for Matty, and he has embarked on a new chapter in life. Now a full-time 
boyfriend, he has traded in his gaming controller for a more relaxed lifestyle. Instead of spending hours in virtual 
battles, Matty now prefers to spend his days sunbathing, basking in the warmth of love and leisure.

Although his departure from the gaming world may have surprised some, Matty's time in the clan will always be 
remembered, and his trash-talk battles with Michael will remain part of the clan's folklore. While his absence leaves 
a void in the competitive gaming arena, Matty has found contentment in his new role as a loving partner, cherishing 
moments of tranquility under the sun. Though he may have bid farewell to the gaming clan, his legacy as a skilled and 
competitive gamer will forever be etched in the memories of those who shared the virtual battlefield with him.
